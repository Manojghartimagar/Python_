Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It is designed to be simple, readable, and easy to learn, making it popular among beginners and professionals alike. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. It has a vast standard library and many external libraries, which makes it suitable for web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. Being platform-independent and open-source, Python allows developers to write code once and run it on different operating systems, making it one of the most versatile and widely used programming languages in the world.
